# HospitalSystem

Computer app that has done in the C#.NET as studying project. In this project I have built a Hosptal System with Excel Data Base.
Each Doctor has to registrer in the system. After that he can upload an Excel file of the pacient health checking or he can input by himself the results of the pacient.
After that he can see the diagnoses and recomendations for the recovery for each diagnose. The doctor also can output the Excel file with all results and diagnoses/recomendation from the programm.

To run the programm you have to install Visual Studio, copy all files to your project and run them.
